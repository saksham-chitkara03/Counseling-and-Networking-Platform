## About This Project

I developed AlumNiti for a counseling stealth startup as part of a confidential engagement. Due to a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), I am unable to share the codebase publicly. Additionally, the NDA requires that some of the data displayed on the live platform is randomized for demonstration purposes. For example, instead of actual recorded podcasts, random YouTube videos are shown, and certain college and branch data may also be randomized or anonymized.

## The Maze: Why AlumNiti?

When engineering students in India take competitive exams like JEE, they face a maze of scattered, conflicting, and unreliable data. Vital statisticsâ€”facilities, branches, placements, fees, cutoffsâ€”are fragmented across sources, and accuracy is inconsistent. This leads to wasted hours and critical choices based on flawed information. Even worse, generic guidance and the lack of accessible mentorship from recent graduates or current students means many regret their decisions, wishing they had known more before choosing.

## The Compass: AlumNiti's Mission

AlumNiti is designed to be the single platform for clarity, connection, and confidence in college and career decisions. Our mission is to empower informed choices through authentic experiences and structured guidance:
- **We Verify:** Consolidating and validating crucial data for reliability.
- **We Connect:** Bridging the gap to relevant, verified student and alumni mentors.
- **We Deliver:** Authentic content and trustworthy AI insights for choices based on capability and interest.

## What AlumNiti Offers

- **Unified Search:** Instantly search across colleges, branches, experts, blogs, and videos from a single search bar, making it easy to find exactly what you need.
- **College-Branch Predictor:** Enter your exam rank and preferences to receive personalized recommendations for the best-fit colleges and branches, using data-driven algorithms and historical trends. *Beta feature: continually improved for reliability.*
- **AI Chatbot:** Get instant answers to your questions about colleges, branches, exams, and the platform itself with an AI-powered assistant trained on a vast knowledge base.
- **Expert Dashboard:** Experts (students/alumni) can manage their session bookings, respond to queries, track earnings, and update their profiles from a dedicated dashboard.
- **Posts:** Share updates, tips, experiences, and questions with the community. Engage with posts from other users, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.
- **AI-powered Content Enhancer:** Automatically improve the clarity, grammar, and impact of user-generated content (posts, blogs, etc.) using advanced AI models.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Platform administrators can oversee all operations, manage users and experts, moderate content, and access analytics to ensure quality and safety.
- **Notification Subsystem:** Receive real-time notifications for session bookings, reminders, new content, and important platform updates, ensuring you never miss out.
- **Wallet Subsystem:** Securely handle payments for sessions, manage expert earnings, and track transaction history within the platform, providing a seamless financial experience.

## The Engine: How It Works

- **Data Integrity:** Robust data validation pipelines ensure all information is trustworthy and up-to-date.
- **User Security:** Secure authentication mechanisms protect user data and privacy.
- **System Performance:** Built with FastAPI (Python) for a high-performance backend, Next.js (React) for a modern frontend, and MongoDB for flexible, scalable data storage.
- **Dashboards:** Dedicated dashboards for experts and admins streamline management and oversight.
- **Privacy & Piracy Controls:** Features like video overlays and access management protect content and user privacy.

## The Journey & Vision

AlumNiti is more than a productâ€”it's a movement to empower students to make better, more informed decisions. Our vision is to expand AlumNiti as an enabler and community: a place to learn, earn, and guide others. Future plans include enhanced AI, secure cloud video, deeper integrations (e.g., Calendly), and expansion across domains.
